# Zendesk_Ticket_Allocation

I have this script running every 15 minuets checking for any new tickets, this will assign the tickets to a random agent and also respond to the ticket reqiestor.

The password is an API Key generated from the Zendesk Dashboard and entered into the script. 
Responce can be edited to suit the runners taste

Any questions let me know
